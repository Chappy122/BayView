# Getting Started
## Prerequisites: 

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


## Usage:
### Step 1: 
Included is an automation script `./start` that composes the website's development environment using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Once Docker has been installed, From the root directory: 

```
git clone https://github.com/heyitsmass/BayView && cd BayView && touch.env
```
‚õî **If you *EVER* need to access [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) while programming, only use the environment variables**  `process.env.DISCORD_API_TOKEN` **and**  `process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`. **DO NOT copy and paste them outside of the**  `.env` **file.** 

### Step 2: 

```chmod +x start && ./start```

üìç<b> *This will create a `.built` file with the build date/time stamped into it, Subsequent calls to ./start will only initialize a new container from the previous image. To update dependencies, pass the `-b|--build` option to rebuild the image or `-h|--help` to display the help menu*</b>

Your output should be similar to: 

```
[+] Building 1.8s (18/18) FINISHED														
...
[+] Running 1/1
‚úî Container bayview-development  Created                                                      		
Attaching to bayview-development

bayview-development  | ‚úì Ready in 2.2s
```

### Step 4: 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result, you should be redirected to the `/home` page indicating proper initialization.

‚ö†Ô∏èFor best results use [FireFox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) with the [React DevTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) addon.

### Additional Notes: 
[FastRefresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) is enabled for the development environment, As long as the server is running then any changes made to files within the original source directory will force the server to recompile. This allows you to quickly and seamlessly update the website during development and see those updates in real-time without have to rebuild the entire Docker container. Check the `docker-compose.yml` file for more information. 

The only changes that will require a restart are made to or 'package.json' while updating dependencies or to the [`instrumentation.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) file which runs when a new server instance is bootstrapped. 
  - This initializes database connections and performs any work that's necessary throughout the lifetime of the website but only needs to occur once. 

## Design Expectations
It is expected these design patterns will be followed upon contributing to the repo, These patterns are intended to make portability, extension and expansion of BayView simple and legible. 

**‚ö†Ô∏è [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is essential!** If you have to pass data or functions deeply within multiple components or across routes then wrap your component in a [Context, create a reducer, develop it's actions](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context), assign the state values and export the context for use across multiple modules. 

**‚ö†Ô∏èAvoid excessively using useEffect**. [You might not need it](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

## Issues: 

üìçIf the server hangs during shutdown attempting to close it with `ctrl+c` then you can either stop it directly from Docker Desktop or open a secondary console window and type `docker kill bayview-development`

üìçWhile potentially unrelated, if you get a `dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied` error then type `chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock` and retry
